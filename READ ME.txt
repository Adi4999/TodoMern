This project is a full stack MERN Todo application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks on their list. 

To set up the project, replace the MongoDB connection code in the 'api/server.js' file with your own code and user password. 


To run the project, open two terminal windows, one in the 'api' directory (for the backend) and one in the 'client' directory (for the frontend). 

In Both terminal, run "npm install" command to install the dependencies


In the 'api' terminal, run the command 'npm start' and in the 'client' terminal, run the command 'npm run start'. 

Congratulations, you now have your own Todo list web application!
